# [](#header-1) Happy thoughts

I just was watching deepmind's workplace and it's really nice.

The thing is maybe to reuse chunks of a neural network. Maybe can implement abstract portions learned in some way in some simulation, and
then apply it to another, by not reusing the whole system, but by reusing this chunks/abstract thoughts in a way.
