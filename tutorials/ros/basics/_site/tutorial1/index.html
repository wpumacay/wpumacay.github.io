<p>Nodes are the basic unit in a ROS application, and they are basically unix processes that can communicate with each other.</p>

<p>The way these nodes communicate is via the piping implemented in the ROS architecture. Digging a bit into the code, each node communicates with each other via RPC ( remove procedure calls ) and some Publihser-Subscriber architecture.</p>
