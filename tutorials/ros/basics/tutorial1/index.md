### Nodes

Nodes are the basic unit in a ROS application, and they are basically unix processes that can communicate with each other.

The way these nodes communicate is via the piping implemented in the ROS architecture. Digging a bit into the code, each node communicates with each other via RPC ( remove procedure calls ) and some Publihser-Subscriber architecture.
