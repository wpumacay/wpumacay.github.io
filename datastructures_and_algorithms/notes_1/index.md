# Some review on Graph Theory

Graphs are an useful data structure that help represent various problems we encounter in computer science that deal with relationship between data. In this section we will make a review of the basics on graph theory.

### Definitions

A graph **G** is a **set** of vertices **V** ( abstract, in the sense that they represent anything ) and a set of vertex pairs or edges **E** ( abstract link between any two vertices in **V** ).

We denote this by:

\\[
	G = ( V, E )
\\]

These graphs come in different kind of flavors, namely:

1. 	Undirected _vs_ Directed
2. 	Weighted _vs_ Unweighted
