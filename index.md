## About me

Hi!!!, I'm Wilbert Pumacay. I'm a 2nd year Msc. student at _Universidad Cat√≥lica San Pablo
(Arequipa-Peru)_, pursuing a degree in Computer Science, and I received my
Bsc. degree in Mechatronics from _Universidad Nacional de Ingenieria (Lima-Peru)_. 

My interests lie in the intersection between Robotics and Machine Learning. I'm currently
working on a framework to test some ideas about robot locomotion and Deep Reinforcement
Learning (link [here](https://github.com/wpumacay/tysocMjc)), which is part of my Msc. thesis.

I spent three years working as a game programmer (before I joined the Msc. program)
at a peruvian game studio called **Bamtang Games**. There I got into programming and
computer science (thanks guys!). I also spent half a semester working as an assistant
for some research projects during the last year of my undergraduate studies, mostly
working with microcontrollers and making interfaces for sensors and actuators needed
for some robotics projects.

If you have any questions or if you'd like to get in touch, don't hesitate and send
me an e-mail to wilbert.pumacay@ucsp.edu.pe.
