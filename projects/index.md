# [](#header-1)Projects

These are some of the projects I've been working on. I'll be documenting some of the projects in my repo here.

*   [Cat1]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/cat1/)  : A rendering engine I've working on while learning the OpenGL API and some computer graphics stuff.

*	[Tysoc]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/tysoc/) : A simulator engine based on Bullet3 that used the before mentioned engine for visualization.

*	[Computer Graphics final project]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/cg/) : A port of the [DeepTerrainRL](https://github.com/xbpeng/DeepTerrainRL) project to Modern OpenGL.
